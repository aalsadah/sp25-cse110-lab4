1. It will output ```3``` because that is what ```i``` is defined to.
2. It will print ```150``` which is the last discounted price calculated.
3. It will print ```150``` as well because that is the price it rounds ```300``` to.
4. the function will return the array: ```[50, 100, 150]``` after storing every discounted and rounded price into the array.
5. We get an error at line 12 because ```i``` was declared in the ```for``` loop scope so it is not defined outside of it.
6. We get an error because ```discountedPrice``` is declared using ```let``` inside a block so it is not accessible outside of it.
7. line 14 will print ```150``` because let is used in the same block as line 14.
8. function will return ```[50, 100, 150]``` because the declarations of the variables all correctly scoped.
9. an error will happen because ```i``` is defined with let so it only exists in that scope.
10. It will print ```3``` the length of the prices list.
11. the function will return [50, 100, 150] all the variables are delcared appropriatly for this to work.
12.
* A : ```student.name```
* B : ```student['Grad Year']```
* C : ```student.greeting()```
* D : ```student['Favorite Teacher'].name```
* E : ```student.courseLoad[0]```
13.
* A : ```'32'```
* B : ```1```
* C : ```3```
* D : ```'3null'```
* E : ```4```
* F : ```0```
* G : ```'3undefined'```
* H : ```Nan```
14.
* A : ```true```
* B : ```false```
* C : ```true```
* D : ```false```
* E : ```false```
* F : ```true```
15. The ```==``` operator compares the **value** of datatypes, while the ```===``` compares the **datatype** of each value.
17. the final result will be `[2, 4, 6]`, the function returns a new array which is filled with the numbers we input  multiplied by 2.
19. `1`  `4`  `3`  `2`
